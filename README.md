# Qhack2022_solutions
Qhack is a quantum computing event including a mixture of scientific conferences, open hackathons and coding challenges organized by Xanadu.

In this repository, you will find "Halo team" submissions of the 25 coding challenges proposed in the Qhack coding challenge 2022.

We will add shortly a brief description of the solutions and the basic algorithms used to solve the problems.
